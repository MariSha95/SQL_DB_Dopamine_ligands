# SQL_DB_Dopamine_ligands


Dataset enriched_dopamine_ec50 (csv) is curated from the ChEMBL database and further enriched with RDKit-calculated molecular properties. It serves as a valuable resource for cheminformatics and machine learning tasks, particularly in drug-target interaction studies. The dataset comprises around 3000 instances, each representing a unique molecule and its interaction with dopamine receptors. 



Project (HW_3) consists of code that filters the database by molecular weights, ec50 values, and dopamine receptor type. It also provides calculations of average values ​​for molecular weights and the number of hydrogen bond donors among the ligands studied. It also provides a visualization of the frequency of certain parameters and a heat map of correlations of numerical values.
